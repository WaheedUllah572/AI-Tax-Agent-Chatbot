Thank you for reaching out to me for tax guidance.\n\nTo answer your question, unfortunately, you cannot claim a deduction for rent if you live with your parents and don't pay them rent.

For example, your parents would need to report the rent income on their tax return, and you would need to keep records of the rent payments.\n\nCan you tell me more about your living situation? Do you pay rent to your parents, or is it a rent-free arrangement?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is Section 80D and how much health insurance premium can I claim?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Section 80D is a wonderful deduction available to individuals and HUFs (Hindu Undivided Families) in India.\n\nSection 80D allows you to claim a deduction for the premium paid towards a health insurance policy for yourself, your spouse, dependent children, and parents.
